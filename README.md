# tokenbridge-ETH-ETHb

The ETH-to-ETHb (NATIVE-TO-ERC) tokenbridge is designed to allow interoperatibility between the Ethereum and Binance smart chain (BSC). It can be used to mint ETHb tokens (BEP20) on Binance smart chain by using one of the bridge components called Home bridge. Similarly, minted tokens can be sent back to Ethereum mainnet from Binance smart chain using the Foreign bridge.
